# Starfall Animation
Once I'd grasped object-oriented programming in Python, I was keen to hone my skills by creating classes and objects in JavaScript. That's when I came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisCourses" target="_blank">Chris Courses</a>, an excellent YouTuber whose tutorials I found both instructive and enjoyable. Although I usually try to avoid relying too heavily on tutorials, I ended up gaining much more than just a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming in JavaScript. Thanks to Chris, I was able to add canvas, basic physics, JS OOP design, and animations to my arsenal of skills.
