# Starfall Animation
After learning object oriented programming in python, I wanted to practice creating classes and objects in Javascript. 
I stumbled on this awesome YouTuber named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisCourses" target="_blank">Chris Courses</a>.
Although I'm not a huge fan of doing tutorials, I learned a LOT more than just object oriented programming in JavaScript.
In the end, I was able to add canvas, physics, OOP design, and animations to my tool box.
